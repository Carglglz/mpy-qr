# mpy-qr

Micropython module for producing QR codes (written in C)

This code is using the fine library from <https://github.com/nayuki/QR-Code-generator>
written by [@nayuki](https://github.com/nayuki) and published under MIT license.

# TODO / Limitations

- almost able to be compiled into a native-code `.mpy` file, but not quite
- does not support Kanji or ECI modes
- needs docs, at least for uqr.make() function's kw args
